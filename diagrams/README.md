# 📊 Network Diagrams

This directory contains visual representations and ASCII art diagrams to help understand networking concepts.

## Contents

Visual aids organized by module to illustrate:
- Network topologies and architectures
- Protocol flows and communication patterns
- Data packet structures
- Request/response cycles
- Security mechanisms

## How to Use

Each diagram is referenced in the corresponding module's `diagrams.md` file. The diagrams use:
- ASCII art for text-based representations
- Mermaid syntax for flowcharts and sequence diagrams
- Descriptions for complex architectures

## Contributing

When adding diagrams:
1. Keep them simple and focused on one concept
2. Use consistent symbols and notation
3. Include a brief description of what the diagram illustrates
4. Reference the diagram in the relevant module's content

# ⚠️ Module Relocated

This module has been renamed and moved as part of the course restructure.

## New Location

**[07-REST-API-Design](../07-REST-API-Design/)**

## Why the Change?

To accommodate critical new modules:
- 05: Working With APIs
- 06: Authentication and Authorization ⭐ CRITICAL
- 08: Databases for APIs ⭐ CRITICAL

The content is the same, just renamed and renumbered for better flow.

## What Should I Do?

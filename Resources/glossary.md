# 📖 Networking Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of networking terms used throughout this course.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

**API Key**: A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to an API.

**Asynchronous**: Operations that don't block execution while waiting for completion.

**Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

**Authorization**: The process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

## B

**Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network connection.

**Bearer Token**: An authentication token sent in the `Authorization` header, typically used with JWT.

**Binary**: Data represented in base-2 format (0s and 1s).

## C

**Cache**: Temporary storage of data for faster access on subsequent requests.

**Certificate**: A digital document that verifies the identity of a website or server.

**Client**: A computer or application that requests services or resources from a server.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A security feature that controls how web pages can request resources from different domains.

**CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete - the four basic operations for data manipulation.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: A security vulnerability where attackers trick users into performing unwanted actions.

## D

**DNS (Domain Name System)**: A system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

**Domain**: A human-readable address for a website (e.g., example.com).

## E

**Encryption**: The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access.

**Endpoint**: A specific URL where an API can be accessed.

## F

**Firewall**: A security system that monitors and controls network traffic.

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol for transferring files between computers.

## G

**Gateway**: A network point that acts as an entrance to another network.

**GET**: An HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server.

## H

**Handshake**: The initial exchange of information to establish a connection.

**Header**: Metadata sent with HTTP requests and responses.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: HTTP with encryption for secure communication.

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol used for transferring web pages.

## I

**Idempotent**: An operation that produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed.

**IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**: A unique numerical identifier for devices on a network.

**IPv4**: Version 4 of IP addressing (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

**IPv6**: Version 6 of IP addressing with more addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

**ISP (Internet Service Provider)**: A company that provides internet access.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data format for exchanging information.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, self-contained way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## L

**Latency**: The time delay between sending and receiving data.

**Load Balancer**: A device that distributes network traffic across multiple servers.

## M

**MAC Address**: A unique hardware identifier for network interfaces.

**Middleware**: Software that sits between an application and the operating system or network.

## O

**OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication.

## P

**Packet**: A unit of data transmitted over a network.

**Payload**: The actual data being transmitted, excluding headers and metadata.

**Ping**: A network utility that tests connectivity to another host.

**Port**: A numerical identifier for a specific process or service on a computer.

**POST**: An HTTP method used to send data to create or update resources.

**Protocol**: A set of rules governing how data is transmitted over a network.

**Proxy**: An intermediary server that forwards requests between clients and servers.

## Q

**Query Parameter**: Data appended to a URL after a question mark (e.g., `?name=value`).

**Query String**: The portion of a URL that contains data to be passed to web applications.

## R

**Rate Limiting**: Controlling the number of requests a user can make to an API within a time period.

**Redirect**: Sending users to a different URL than the one requested.

**Request**: A message sent from a client to a server asking for a resource or action.

**Response**: A message sent from a server back to a client in reply to a request.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**: An architectural style for designing networked applications.

**Router**: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.

## S

**Server**: A computer or program that provides services or resources to clients.

**Session**: A temporary connection between two communicating devices.

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol for sending emails.

**Socket**: An endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network.

**SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol for secure remote access to computers.

**SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)**: Cryptographic protocols for secure communication.

**Stateless**: A protocol where each request is independent and contains all necessary information.

**Status Code**: A three-digit number indicating the result of an HTTP request.

**Subnet**: A subdivision of an IP network.

## T

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures data delivery.

**Timeout**: The maximum time to wait for a response before giving up.

**Token**: A piece of data that represents authentication credentials or permissions.

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: The successor to SSL, providing secure communication.

## U

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A fast, connectionless protocol that doesn't guarantee delivery.

**URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: The address of a resource on the internet (e.g., https://example.com/page).

**URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A string that identifies a resource (URLs are a type of URI).

## V

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A secure, encrypted connection over a public network.

## W

**WebSocket**: A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## X

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**XML (Extensible Markup Language)**: A markup language for encoding documents in a format that is both human and machine-readable.

# ⚠️ Module Relocated

This module has been moved and renumbered as part of the course restructure.

## New Location

**[04-HTTP-Fundamentals](../04-HTTP-Fundamentals/)**

## Why the Change?

To accommodate new modules on:
- Developer Tools Setup (now Module 03)
- Working With APIs (now Module 05)
- Authentication and Authorization (now Module 06)

The content is the same, just in a new location with updated navigation.

## What Should I Do?

- **New students**: Follow the new structure, this is now Module 04
- **Current students**: If you've completed this module, continue with [05-Working-With-APIs](../05-Working-With-APIs/)

## Migration Guide

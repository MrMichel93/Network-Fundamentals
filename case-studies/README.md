# 📚 Case Studies

This directory contains real-world networking scenarios and case studies to illustrate practical applications of the concepts learned.

## Purpose

Bridge theory and practice through:
- Real-world networking challenges and solutions
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Performance optimization stories
- Security incident responses
- System migration experiences

## Contents

- `scalability-challenges.md` - Scaling web applications and APIs
- `api-evolution.md` - Versioning and maintaining public APIs
- `realtime-architecture.md` - Building real-time systems with WebSockets
- `protocol-selection.md` - Choosing the right protocol for the job
- `security-incidents.md` - Learning from security breaches
- `performance-optimization.md` - Optimizing network performance
- `migration-stories.md` - Moving between protocols and architectures

## Structure of Each Case Study

Each case study follows this format:

1. **Background** - Context and initial situation
2. **Challenge** - The problem that needed solving
3. **Solution** - Approach taken and implementation
4. **Results** - Outcomes and lessons learned
5. **Key Takeaways** - Practical lessons for your projects
6. **Discussion Questions** - Prompts for deeper thinking

## How to Use

1. Read case studies after completing related modules
2. Think about how you would approach each challenge
3. Analyze the trade-offs in the decisions made
4. Discuss with peers or mentors
5. Apply lessons to your own projects

## Learning from Real Examples

These case studies are inspired by:
- Open-source project evolutions
- Published post-mortems
- Industry best practices
- Common architectural patterns
- Documented incidents and resolutions

Understanding how others solved real problems helps you develop intuition for your own networking challenges.

# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals Course

Welcome to the **Networking Fundamentals** course! This comprehensive course is designed for beginner to intermediate programmers who want to understand how networked applications communicate.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course will take you from basic networking concepts to building real-time web applications. You'll learn how data flows across the internet, how to build and consume APIs, and how to create interactive networked applications.

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 weeks (2-3 hours per week)  
**Target Audience:** High school students or self-learners with basic programming knowledge

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How the internet works (IP addresses, DNS, routing, packets)
- HTTP protocol and web communication fundamentals
- Building and consuming RESTful APIs
- Real-time communication with WebSockets
- Understanding different network protocols (TCP, UDP, FTP, SMTP, SSH)

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. **Follow the modules in order** - Each module builds on previous knowledge
2. **Read the lessons carefully** - Take notes and try to understand concepts before moving to code
3. **Run all code examples** - Type them out yourself rather than copy-pasting
4. **Complete the exercises** - This is where real learning happens!
5. **Build the projects** - Apply multiple concepts together
6. **Use the hints** - If you get stuck, check the expandable hint sections
7. **Review solutions** - After attempting exercises, compare with provided solutions

## 🎓 Learning Path

```
Prerequisites → Internet Basics → HTTP → REST APIs → WebSockets → Other Protocols → Security → Projects
```

**Recommended pace:**
- Week 1: Prerequisites + How The Internet Works

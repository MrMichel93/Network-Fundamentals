# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals Course

Welcome to the **Networking Fundamentals** course! This comprehensive course is designed for beginner to intermediate programmers who want to understand how networked applications communicate.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course will take you from basic networking concepts to building real-time web applications. You'll learn how data flows across the internet, how to build and consume APIs, and how to create interactive networked applications.

**Total Course Hours:** 39-56 hours  
**Estimated Time:** 13-19 weeks (3 hours/week), 10-14 weeks (4 hours/week), or 8-11 weeks (5 hours/week)  
**Target Audience:** High school students or self-learners with basic programming knowledge

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How the internet works (IP addresses, DNS, routing, packets)
- HTTP protocol and web communication fundamentals
- Building and consuming RESTful APIs
- Real-time communication with WebSockets
- Understanding different network protocols (TCP, UDP, FTP, SMTP, SSH)
- Network security basics (HTTPS, TLS/SSL, authentication)
- Practical tools for debugging and testing networked applications

## 🔒 Security Throughout: A DevSecOps Approach

Unlike traditional networking courses that treat security as an afterthought or final module, this course integrates security practices throughout every stage of learning. This is **security-first education** - you'll learn to build secure applications from day one, not retrofit security later.

### Security Integration by Module

- **Module 00 - Prerequisites:** Secure development environment setup, protecting credentials
- **Module 01 - Internet Basics:** Understanding security implications of network architecture, packet sniffing awareness
- **Module 02 - HTTP Fundamentals:** HTTP vs HTTPS, secure headers, cookie security
- **Module 03 - REST APIs:** API authentication, rate limiting, input validation, secure data handling
- **Module 04 - WebSockets:** Secure WebSocket connections (wss://), origin validation, message sanitization
- **Module 05 - Other Protocols:** SSH key management, secure file transfers, encrypted email
- **Module 06 - Security Basics:** Comprehensive security review, TLS/SSL deep-dive, common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

### Why Security-First Matters

**This is DevSecOps in practice** - security as a core principle, not an addon. In the real world:
- 🚨 **Security breaches are common** - small businesses and applications with poor security are frequent targets
- 💰 **Data breaches are expensive** - costs can reach millions in damages, legal fees, and reputation loss
- ⚡ **Prevention is cheaper than fixes** - addressing security during development is far more cost-effective than fixing vulnerabilities in production

By learning security practices alongside networking fundamentals, you'll:
- ✅ Build secure applications by default
- ✅ Understand threat models as you learn each protocol
- ✅ Develop security-conscious coding habits early
- ✅ Be job-ready for modern DevSecOps environments

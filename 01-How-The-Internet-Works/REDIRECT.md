# ⚠️ Module Relocated

This module has been split and reorganized as part of the course restructure.

## New Locations

The content from this module has been divided into:

1. **[01-Internet-Basics](../01-Internet-Basics/)** - Technical fundamentals
   - IP addresses and DNS
   - Packets and routing
   - Network layers (simplified OSI model)
   - Network diagnostic tools

2. **[02-How-The-Web-Works](../02-How-The-Web-Works/)** - Web-specific concepts
   - Clients and servers
   - URLs and domains
   - How browsers work
   - Web page loading process

## Why the Change?

The original module combined too many concepts. The new structure:
- Separates internet infrastructure from web-specific concepts
- Provides better learning progression
- Allows more depth in each topic

## What Should I Do?

- **New students**: Follow the new structure starting with [01-Internet-Basics](../01-Internet-Basics/)
- **Current students**: If you've completed this module, review both new modules briefly, then continue with [03-Developer-Tools-Setup](../03-Developer-Tools-Setup/)

## Migration Guide

See [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md) for complete details on the restructuring.

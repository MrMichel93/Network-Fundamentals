# ⚠️ Module Split and Expanded

This module has been split into two comprehensive modules with expanded content.

## New Locations

The content from this module has been significantly expanded into:

1. **[12-HTTPS-and-TLS](../12-HTTPS-and-TLS/)** - Deep dive into encryption
   - How HTTPS encryption works
   - TLS/SSL protocols explained
   - Certificates and Certificate Authorities
   - Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Setting up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

2. **[13-Network-Security-Best-Practices](../13-Network-Security-Best-Practices/)** - Comprehensive security
   - Defense in depth strategy
   - Complete security checklist
   - Security testing techniques
   - Incident response planning
   - OWASP Top 10
   - Industry standards and compliance

## Why the Change?

Security is too important for one module! The new structure:
- Dedicates proper attention to HTTPS/TLS
- Provides comprehensive security coverage
- Includes modern best practices
- Covers security testing and standards

## What Should I Do?

- **New students**: Follow the new structure, take both modules 12 and 13
- **Current students**: **Strongly recommended** to take both new modules as they contain significantly expanded and updated content

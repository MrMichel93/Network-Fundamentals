# ⚠️ Module Relocated

This module has been moved and renumbered as part of the course restructure.

## New Location

**[11-Other-Protocols](../11-Other-Protocols/)**

## Why the Change?

To maintain logical flow after new security modules were added.

The content is the same, just in a new location with updated navigation.

## What Should I Do?

- **New students**: Follow the new structure
- **Current students**: If you've completed this module, continue with the new security modules:
  - [12-HTTPS-and-TLS](../12-HTTPS-and-TLS/)
  - [13-Network-Security-Best-Practices](../13-Network-Security-Best-Practices/)

## Migration Guide

See [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md) for complete details on the restructuring.
